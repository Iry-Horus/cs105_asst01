# cs105_asst01

This is the first assignment for my CompSci 105 class. The assignment specifications are included in a PDF. This assignment required me to do polynomial manipulation and construct a rudimentary gridlocked traffic simulator. 

Run TestProgram.py in the same folder as Asst1.py to execute some sample inputs.
